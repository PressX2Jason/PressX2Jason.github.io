    "introduction": "I've worked in many different places, from medium sized companies with a start-up feel, to large international corporations. As a jack of all trades, I've worked on a wild variety of projects, from creating new in-house tools, to migrating old customers onto a new system, to maintaining and expanding enterprise solutions. I have recently returned from a two and half month trip of Europe with my girlfriend and I'm looking for opportunities to expand my horizons. As an avid gamer, I enjoy playing all genre of games, from RTSs to RPGs to even board games. I like to balance out my activities by exploring the numerous trails around Metro Vancouver.",
